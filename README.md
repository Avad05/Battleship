# Battleship
Battleship a board based game is being developed

ë£° How to Play

### 1. Objective

The goal of Battleship is to be the first player to sink all of your opponent's ships.

### 2. The Fleet

Each player has a fleet of 5 ships of varying lengths:
* Carrier (5 squares)
* Battleship (4 squares)
* Cruiser (3 squares)
* Submarine (3 squares)
* Destroyer (2 squares)

### 3. Setup

* At the beginning of the game, each player secretly places their 5 ships on their own 10x10 grid.
* Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
* Ships cannot overlap or hang off the grid.

### 4. Gameplay

* Players take turns firing a shot at a single square on their opponent's grid by calling out the coordinates (e.g., "A5", "G9").
* The opponent must announce whether the shot is a **"Hit!"** or a **"Miss!"**.
* A hit is marked on the attacking player's grid (usually with a red peg or color) to track their progress. A miss is also marked (usually with a white peg or color) to avoid firing at the same square again.
* When all the squares of a single ship have been hit, the owner of the ship must announce, **"You sunk my [ship name]!"**

### 5. Winning the Game

The first player to sink all five of their opponent's ships wins the game!
